    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>200g butter, plus extra for greasing</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>4 tbsp milk</li>
        <li>200g golden syrup</li>
        <li>85g treacle</li>
        <li>85g light soft brown sugar</li>
        <li>100g medium oatmeal</li>
        <li>250g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 tbsp ground ginger</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Butter a deep 22cm square cake tin and line with baking parchment. Beat the egg and milk together with a fork.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Gently melt the syrup, treacle, sugar and butter together in a large pan until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat. Mix together the oatmeal, flour and ginger and stir into the syrup mixture, followed by the egg and milk.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Pour the mixture into the tin and bake for 50 mins – 1 hr until the cake feels firm and a little crusty on top. Cool in the tin then wrap in more parchment and foil. Keep for up to five days before eating if you can – it’ll become softer and stickier the longer you leave it, up to two weeks.</p>
